# vault-cloud-bootstrap: Claude Code cloud environment setup for an Obsidian vault.
#
# Run by bootstrap.sh, which is pasted as the environment's "Setup script". The
# environment build is cached into the snapshot and skipped on later sessions,
# so a change here only lands once the bootstrap's SETUP_COMMIT points at it.
# Installs tooling, optionally seeds ~/vault from a git backup, and installs into
# the cached image:
#
#   ~/.claude/hooks/vault-sync-pull.sh   SessionStart: launches the bg worker (keyless)
#   ~/.claude/hooks/.decrypt.sh          keyed decrypt for the current project (ephemeral)
#   ~/.claude/hooks/vault-sync-push.sh   Stop: pushes vault edits
#   ~/.claude/hooks/vault-doctor.sh      diagnostic report, run on demand
#   /home/user/CLAUDE.md                 vault instructions for every session
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   AGE_KEY          from the bootstrap; never committed. Empty disables .env
#                    decryption.
#   VAULT_SEED_REPO  git backup of the vault to seed from. Empty skips seeding.
#   (git auth)       the bootstrap passes its GitHub token, if any, to git
#                    through GIT_CONFIG_*, which the seed clone inherits.
#   CLAUDE_MD_PATH   where the session CLAUDE.md goes (override for testing).
#
# Seeding:
#   An Obsidian-only first sync fetches every file one by one (minutes). With a
#   seed repo, ~/vault is instead filled from the git backup in one bulk copy at
#   build time. If the clone fails it is non-fatal: sessions then fall back to a
#   full Obsidian download. A seeded vault has no sync history, and a plain
#   bidirectional sync would treat the backup's files (all stamped "now") as
#   newer and upload them, reverting recent edits and resurrecting deleted
#   notes. So the seed carries a marker, .seeded-from-git: while it exists the
#   pull worker syncs in mirror-remote mode (download-only, server wins,
#   backup-only files removed) and the push hook does nothing. After the first
#   complete pass the worker switches back to bidirectional and drops the
#   marker. _env/ is left out of the seed so the snapshot never holds the
#   ciphertext; it arrives through Obsidian at session time.
#
# Key lifetime / threat model:
#   The age key lives only in the bootstrap (the environment's setup script) and
#   in .decrypt.sh; it reaches this script as AGE_KEY and is never written to the
#   repo. Never `set -x` here or in the bootstrap: the build log would print it.
#   .decrypt.sh is part of the cached image, so every session starts with it on
#   disk. The SessionStart hook returns immediately and runs the sync in a
#   detached background worker, so the agent is never blocked on Obsidian. The
#   worker retries sync up to 10 times, 60s apart. On a successful sync it
#   materializes THIS project's secrets (every file under _env/<repo>/ in the
#   vault) and then removes .decrypt.sh via an EXIT trap (which also fires if
#   all retries fail, so the key never outlives the worker). Until then the key
#   is on disk, readable by the session's agent like any other file: this design
#   keeps the key out of the repo and the environment variables, it does not
#   hide it from a session that goes looking.
